gdnsd (2.3.0-1) stable; urgency=medium
  * New major upstream release.
    Bugfixes:
    - Comments at the end of RRs using RFC 3597 syntax now work properly with
      whitespace, fixes Github issue 147.
    - UDPv6 listening sockets no longer fail fatally if IPV6_DONTFRAG cannot be
      set on them, possibly fixing Github issue 115 for some OpenVZ+Debian
      installations.
    Features:
    - any_mitigation - New boolean config option, default true.  When
      enabled, gdnsd sends empty truncated responses to ANY queries over
      UDP, which mitigates their use in amplified reflection attacks and
      forces legitimate clients to use TCP for these queries.  In the
      future, the behavior of this option may be relaxed in combination with
      other more-general mitigation strategies such as RRL and/or cookies.
    - The configuration language's $include{} directive now supports
      including whole directories or glob wildcards.  The previous behavior
      was to treat the include pathname as a singular literal filename.  The
      new behavior first checks whether the pathname is the literal name of
      an existing directory.  If so, all files within will be included (as
      if the glob pattern "/*" were appended), and it will not be an error
      if no matching files exist.  Otherwise, the pathname is treated as a
      glob wildcard match, and it will be an error if no matches exist.
    - plugin_extmon has a new per-service option 'max_proc' which defaults to
      zero.  If non-zero, this sets the limit on the number of concurrent
      commands that will be run.  If the limit is exceeded, excess commands are
      rescheduled for 0.1 seconds later. After a few runs, the processes will
      be spread out enough to run without running into the limit.  This avoids
      thundering herds of subprocess executions at startup in large
      configurations.  Contributed by ScaleEngine / Alan Jude.
    - CAA records are now natively supported in the normal rdata format from
      RFC 6844.  CAA records continue to be supported in RFC 3597 generic
      format as well, although this is not recommended going forward.
    - plugin_geoip has a new top-level option "undefined_datacenters_ok", which
      allows resources to leave some of their map's datacenters undefined.
      Enabling this can be dangerous, see warnings in the documentation.

gdnsd (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libmaxminddb >= 1.2.0. This is not strictly needed, but
    building with lower versions means that we depened on the library's
    internals which are known to not be ABI-safe with newer versions.
  * Address incompatibility with newer versions of Net::DNS (libnet-dns-perl).
    Net::DNS::RR:SIG was found in the system copy, but others like
    Net::DNS::RR:NXT were not, resulting in an FTBFS. (Closes: #830184)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8.
  * Pass -O--dbgsym-migration to dh_strip and relax the debhelper dependency
    to ease backports.

gdnsd (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Falls back from F_OFD_SETLK to F_SETLK at runtime if the runtime
      environment differs from the compile-time one. (Closes: #805571)
    - Fixes incompatibilities with libmaxminddb 1.1.5.
    - Fixes reproducibility issues (embedded hostname/build date).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7, no changes needed.
  * Upstream is signing their releases starting with 2.2.3; add Brandon's GPG
    key to debian/upstream/signing-key.asc and adjust debian/watch to check
    for the .asc.
  * Migrate from our own -dbg package to the automatic -dbgsym package.
  * Adjust libunwind-dev's architecture set: drop ia64; add mipsel, mips64el.

gdnsd (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add build-dependency on libmaxminddb-dev for GeoIP2 support.
  * Add build-dependency on libunwind-dev for stacktraces on fatals.
  * Remove build-dep on geoip-database. It was only used for running the test
    suite, which now expects specific versions of the GeoIP databases.
  * Remove XS-Testsuite header, obsolete since dpkg 1.17.11.
  * Add /var/lib/gdnsd to debian/dirs.
  * Add several security options to the systemd unit file, inherited from
    upstream's own unit file.

    meantime.
